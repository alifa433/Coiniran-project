## Introduction

The Decentralized Voting Application is a blockchain-based voting system built on the Ethereum platform. It allows users to create polls, cast their votes, and view poll results in a transparent and secure manner. This project is designed to showcase the power of blockchain technology in ensuring the integrity of voting processes.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:
Features
Create Polls: Users can create new polls by providing a title, options, and a closing date. These polls are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.

Vote in Polls: Registered users can cast their votes in existing polls.

View Results: The results of each poll, including the number of votes for each option, can be viewed by anyone.

Secure and Transparent: All voting data is stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring the integrity and transparency of the voting process.

Project Structure
The project directory contains the following files and directories:

Voting.sol: The Solidity smart contract for the decentralized voting system.

index.html: The HTML user interface for the application.

styles.css: CSS styles for the user interface.

app.js: JavaScript code to interact with the smart contract and manage the user interface.

test/: Directory for test files. These files contain test cases to verify the functionality of the smart contract.

Technologies Used
Solidity: The smart contract language for building decentralized applications on Ethereum.

Ethereum: The blockchain platform that powers the decentralized voting system.

Web3.js (or ethers.js): Libraries for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain from a web application.

HTML/CSS: Standard web technologies used for the user interface.

JavaScript: Programming language for building interactive web applications.
